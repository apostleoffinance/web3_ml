Hypothesis for Crypto Traders Classifier Using Logistic Regression

Hypothesis:
The classification of crypto traders (represented by the trader_class_numeric variable) can be predicted using key trading metrics 
such as portfolio_return, base_cumulative_return, and other numerical features.

Supporting Theory:
Key Predictive Features:

portfolio_return and base_cumulative_return show moderate positive correlations with trader classification, 
suggesting that higher returns are indicative of better trading performance. These features are likely critical in determining trader classes.
The strong positive coefficients of these features in the logistic regression model further validate their influence on predicting trader classes.
Weak or Negligible Relationships:

Features like number_of_trades and unique_tokens_traded exhibit weak correlations with trader classification. 
This suggests that while these metrics provide some information, their contribution to the classification model is minimal compared to return-based metrics.
Role of Daily Sharpe Ratio:

Despite its weak negative correlation with trader_class_numeric, daily_sharpe_ratio has a positive coefficient in the logistic regression model, 
indicating that risk-adjusted returns may contribute to identifying successful traders, though less significantly than raw return metrics.
Accuracy and Model Performance:

The model achieves a high accuracy score of 0.98, indicating that the selected features effectively predict trader classes within the dataset.

Limitations and Next Steps:
While the linear model provides strong accuracy, correlation analysis only captures linear relationships. 
Non-linear patterns and interactions between features may exist and require exploration through advanced models or visualizations.
Proposed Hypothesis for Further Validation:
"Crypto traders classified as 'good traders' are more likely to exhibit higher portfolio returns and cumulative returns, 
while features like the number of trades and the diversity of tokens traded have negligible predictive power for trader classification."
